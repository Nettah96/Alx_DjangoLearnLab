# Django Security Configuration Summary – LibraryProject

## HTTPS and Secure Redirects
- Enabled `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` to ensure all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
- Configured HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with `SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000`, `INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`, and `PRELOAD`.

## Secure Cookies
- Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` to True to ensure cookies are sent over secure HTTPS connections.

## Secure Headers
- Enabled `X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'` to prevent clickjacking.
- Enabled `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` to prevent MIME-type sniffing.
- Enabled `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` to activate browser-level XSS protections.

## Deployment Notes
- SSL certificates installed using Let’s Encrypt.
- Nginx is configured to redirect HTTP to HTTPS and proxy requests to the Django app.

## Review Status
All recommended Django security settings are enabled. Manual tests confirm redirection to HTTPS and proper headers in responses.
